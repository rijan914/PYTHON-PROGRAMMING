Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :-  Very Hard Days  to pass [7 Days Before Exam + 4 Days Mid Semester Study]
Goal - Score Above 45 /80 in the finals  [Aim high if difficult question comes you can pass]

The subject is 95% Numerical .This subject be finished for about 45-50 marks mid semester. There are limited theory [5 % ] don't expect to pass by studying just theory. It's impossible.

This exam is the first exam of the semester so start a week ahead in advance try to finish 2 days before exam. You will certainly miss the mark and finish in the evening of the day before. 

It will take you 1 and half day after sitting down to study to just start studying.

Numerical & Theory

Finish The Tutorial Question Listed below and  old question collection numericals.  

As Numerical are connected with theory so see the theory carefully and practice the numerical carefully. Finish Numerical First.

Watch The YouTube Videos First Then Only go to the notes as it will help you to get a overview of how to solve.

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- 6 Days. [3.5 days before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month]  Goal - Score More than 60/80 Marks in final exam Chapter 4 Numerical + Chapter 8 Numerical [1 Day] [Finish Thoroughly Before Exam Month] Chapter 1,5,8 [1.5 Day]  [Finish Before Exam Month] [Finish Them and remember the Header(Ch. 5) And Algorithm(Ch. 8) ] Chapter 2,3,4,6,7 [Just Watch The YouTube Videos Thoroughly No Worries] [1 Days] At Exam Month Chapter 1,4 [1st Day Evening + 2nd Day Morning]  Chapter 2,3,5 [2nd Day]  [Easy + Easy + Hard] Chapter 6,7,8 [3rd Day]  [Easy + Easy + Hard] To guarantee to pass, starting at the exam month is not a sure way like other subjects.   The chapters with most marks are hard and you  always run into the probability that from the chapters you have studied  hard questions or unexpected question come.  Concerning the theory the notes are enough and also for the Numerical of chapter 8 can be easily understood
